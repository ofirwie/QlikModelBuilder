          "text": "You are a senior QA architect reviewing a test plan for a VS Code Extension Wizard. Score COMPLETENESS and CORRECTNESS from 1-10.\n\nThe test plan includes ALL 19 sections:\n\n1. OVERVIEW: Purpose (zero defects), Goal (160 automated + 30 manual = 190 tests), Environment (Docker + VS Code Server with real Qlik Cloud tenant)\n\n2. LAYER ARCHITECTURE: 5 layers with BLOCKING principle - Layer N must pass 100% before Layer N+1 runs\n\n3. FOLDER STRUCTURE: checkpoints/, screenshots/, logs/, fixtures/, results/, specs/, runner.ts\n\n4. RECOVERY MECHANISM: Checkpoint interface, heartbeat every 5s, crash detection, atomic writes with .bak\n\n5. TEST CASES (128 core layer tests): L0=15, L1=28, L2=45, L3=40 (includes 20 visual regression)\n\n6. RISK MITIGATION TABLE (6 risks with Impact, Probability, Contingency, Trigger)\n\n7. TASK BREAKDOWN (10 tasks with Duration, Dependencies, Critical Path, DoD)\n\n8. RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS (Human, Tool, Infrastructure, Data)\n\n9. TESTING STRATEGY (5 phases with Coverage, Tools, Acceptance, Rollback)\n\n10. SECURITY TESTING (8 tests): SEC-001 to SEC-008\n\n11. PERFORMANCE TESTING (6 tests): PERF-001 to PERF-006 with benchmarks\n\n12. L10N/I18N TESTING (6 tests): L10N-001 to L10N-006\n\n13. TEST DATA MANAGEMENT: Tenant strategy, test files, refresh cycle\n\n14. BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY (6 tests): COMPAT-001 to COMPAT-006\n\n15. AUTOMATED ACCESSIBILITY (6 checks): A11Y-001 to A11Y-006 with axe-core\n\n16. TEST COUNT RECONCILIATION (NEW - addresses previous feedback):\n    Complete breakdown table showing:\n    - Layer 0: 15 tests (L0-001 to L0-015)\n    - Layer 1: 28 tests (L1-001 to L1-028)\n    - Layer 2: 45 tests (L2-001 to L2-045)\n    - Layer 3: 40 tests (L3-001 to L3-040)\n      - L3 breakdown: 5 full flow + 5 error recovery + 5 state mgmt + 20 visual regression + 5 Qlik Cloud = 40\n    - Security: 8 tests (SEC-001 to SEC-008)\n    - Performance: 6 tests (PERF-001 to PERF-006)\n    - L10n/I18n: 6 tests (L10N-001 to L10N-006)\n    - Compatibility: 6 tests (COMPAT-001 to COMPAT-006)\n    - Accessibility: 6 tests (A11Y-001 to A11Y-006)\n    AUTOMATED SUBTOTAL: 160 tests\n    - Layer 4 Manual: 15 checklists (L4-001 to L4-015)\n    - Exploratory: 15 sessions (EXP-001 to EXP-015)\n    MANUAL SUBTOTAL: 30 tests\n    GRAND TOTAL: 190 tests\n\n17. EXPLORATORY TESTING (NEW - addresses previous feedback):\n    15 time-boxed sessions (~6 hours total):\n    EXP-001: First impression (30m) - New user experience, discoverability\n    EXP-002: Break the wizard (30m) - Try unusual inputs, edge cases\n    EXP-003: Large data (30m) - 100MB files, many columns\n    EXP-004: Rapid interactions (20m) - Fast clicking, interrupting flows\n    EXP-005: State manipulation (20m) - DevTools, storage editing\n    EXP-006: Network conditions (20m) - Slow/offline network\n    EXP-007: Theme variations (15m) - Light, dark, high contrast\n    EXP-008: Panel resizing (15m) - Different sizes, edge cases\n    EXP-009: Concurrent ops (20m) - Multiple files, wizards\n    EXP-010: Memory pressure (20m) - Many extensions loaded\n    EXP-011: Qlik edge cases (30m) - Large apps, many fields\n    EXP-012: Keyboard-only (20m) - Complete flow, no mouse\n    EXP-013: Screen reader (30m) - NVDA/VoiceOver\n    EXP-014: Error messages (20m) - Clarity, helpfulness\n    EXP-015: Recovery flows (20m) - Resume after issues\n    Execution: After 160 automated pass, before Layer 4, document in exploratory-findings.md, critical issues block release, findings generate new tests.\n\n18. FLAKY TEST MANAGEMENT: Zero flaky policy, detection (2x retry), quarantine, investigation (24h RCA), fix, reintegrate (3 passes)\n\n19. SUCCESS CRITERIA:\n    Automated (160 tests): All pass, zero flaky (3x), visual baselines approved, Qlik verified, security pass, perf benchmarks met, a11y pass\n    Exploratory (15 sessions): All complete, findings documented, no critical unfixed\n    Manual (15 checklists): All pass, user confirms production ready, sign-off documented\n\nCOMMUNICATION PLAN: Per Test logging, Per Layer checkpoints, On Failure stop immediately, On Completion HTML report, Escalation for Qlik API issues\n\nALL PREVIOUS FEEDBACK ADDRESSED:\n1. Test Count Reconciliation: Section 16 provides exact breakdown with ID ranges for all 190 tests\n2. Exploratory Testing: Section 17 provides 15 time-boxed sessions with specific charters and durations\n\nRespond ONLY with this exact JSON format:\n{\"completeness\": 10, \"correctness\": 10, \"missing\": [], \"recommendations\": [], \"status\": \"APPROVED\"}"
